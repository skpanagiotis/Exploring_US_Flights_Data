# Exploring US Flights Data
This repository includes an analysis of US Flights Data. This analysis was done for
the purpose of the [1st Assignment](flights.ipynb) of the course Applied Machine Learning.

## The Dataset
The Dataset can be found in the [Airline On-Time Performance Data](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Tables.asp?DB_ID=120&DB_Name=Airline%20On-Time%20Performance%20Data&DB_Short_Name=On-Time#)
and in particular we use the flights that have been recorded in **year 2018**.
The data we use in this analysis can be found [here](https://auebgr-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/louridas_aueb_gr/EbeTzde1LddFmqNWBFWWxNcBj5tDR_zvzDHvqqcmnndeEQ?e=0pwH6j).

## The Analysis
The purpose of the [analysis](exploring_US_flights.ipynb) is to answer the questions of the [Assignment](flight.ipynb).
Flights delays, the number of flights per airport and also an analysis of delays are examined in more
detail, calculating the probability of a flight being delayed based on Airport Origin and Airport Destination.
